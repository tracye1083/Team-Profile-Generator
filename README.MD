Tenth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

***

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a Node.js command-line application, using JavaScript with [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), that the user provides information about employees who will be on a software engineering team. The application will automatically create a HTML webpage that displays directory informational summaries for each team member.
